Explore an assortment of computer vision models.
Three initial learning rates: 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001
Try both all-parameter finetuning and output layer transfer learning
patience = 3
lr scheduler used

results:
not much difference between full finetuning and transfer learning 
resnet50 had slightly better accuracy than vgg16
lr=0.0001 seems to be in the right neighborhood

try visiontransformer embedding and clustering

try svm and vanilla tsne/kmeans

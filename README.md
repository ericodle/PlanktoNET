<h3 align="center">PlanktoNET: Automated identification of planktonic biodiversity around Okinawa and Hokkaido, Japan</h3>

  <p align="center">
  This repository houses code generated during development of PlanktoNET, which is intended for a broader project exploring the biodiversity of plankton around Japan. This project is a joint effort between research teams at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and Hokkaido University.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this Project

Automated data collection is enabled using an imaging flow cytobot (FCB) which
generates large datasets that can be used for monitoring marine biodiversity.
However, the bottleneck for analysis is often that species identification requires
specific expertise and is extremely time consuming.
Currently, the available software packages do not have their training dataset and
code available which restricts the flexibility for application by groups or locations.
Here we propose to develop an open-source software package designed for batch
identification of plankton using a classifier to process data collected from an FCB.
Samples will be collected from ecologically different locations, Okinawa and
Hokkaido; 3 sites in Okinawa (Sesoko island, Ikei Island, and Seragaki) and 2 sites in
Hokkaido (Otaru, Akkeshi). A training dataset will be generated from samples
collected which we will use for training and testing.

## Getting Started

Download this repository by going up to the green "Code" button at the top right and clicking "Download ZIP".

Alternatively, you can also clone the repo directly using the following command.

  ```sh
  # Replace "your_folderpath_here" with the actual folder where you want the project to go.
  cd /your_folderpath_here
  git clone git@github.com:ericodle/J_PlanktoNET.git
  ```

> __For this example, the working directory is the repository root directory.__ 

### Install dependencies using pip

  ```sh
  # Install dependencies if necessary. 
  # You may want to work in a virtual environment. Conda environments are nice for that.
  pip install torch torchvision
  ```

### Download test dataset

> The training/testing image dataset containing around 7,000 photos can be obtained (here). These images were acquired during a single collection session using the Imaging FlowCytobot (https://mclanelabs.com/imaging-flowcytobot). 
> We recommend downloading the images directly into the root project folder.

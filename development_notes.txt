experimentation workflow:

      1) Pilot experiments were performed with various architectures to hone in on optimal training parameters
             (training results output: "pilot_experiments" folder)

                                  |                                                           
                                  V                                                                
 
       2) Trained ResNet and ViT models on McLaneLabs_set
             (training results output: "train_testing" folder > "mclanelabs_set_training")

                                  |
                                  V

        3) Trained ResNet and ViT models separately on OIST_set
             (training results output: "train_testing" folder > "OIST_set_training")

                                  |
                                  V

        4) Trained ResNet and ViT models on both sets using double_train (finetune) scripts
            (training results output: "train_testing" folder > "combined_set_training")

                                  |
                                  V

        5) Evaluated models on 100 randomly selected images from each class (or however many exist)
           Included ROC/AUC analysis
           Evaluation image sets are stored in image_sets>eval_sets (used image_preprocess.py and extract_testset.py to generate)
            (evaluation results output: "eval_testing" folder)

                                  |
                                  V

        6) OIST_Unknown_preproceessed set used as real-world test of model performance
           sort.py scripts used to execute sort with the trained models.
           Included confidence calculation
            (sort results output: "sort_testing" folder)
